# CombinedANABotV1
 tool that converts PDF manuals into structured JSON metadata and generates embeddings compatible with the existing A.N.A Bot program. Contains both components of the project, creating and usage. 

You need to add a directory within your project named manuals with the PDF's inside.

You don't need the metadata, embeddings, and index files I've included. If you download the converters requirements and run the converter with a different set of PDF's in there, it will create those respective files :) 

I've updated the code and included both the program I used to create the metadata as well as the program that indexes and shows the user everything together. 
Here's my projects structure :
